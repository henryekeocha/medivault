# AWS Cognito Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating our authentication system from NextAuth.js to AWS Cognito for the Medical Image Sharing application.

## Current Authentication System

Currently, the application uses NextAuth.js with the following features:
- Email/password authentication
- JWT tokens for session management
- Custom user roles (ADMIN, PROVIDER, PATIENT)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with TOTP
- Token refresh and revocation
- Security logging

## Migration Goals

1. Transition to AWS Cognito for authentication while maintaining all existing functionality
2. Minimize disruption to users during the migration
3. Enhance security and scalability
4. Leverage AWS-native features for better integration with other AWS services

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation and Infrastructure Setup (2 weeks)

1. **Create AWS Cognito Resources**
   - Set up User Pool with appropriate attributes
   - Configure App Client
   - Set up Identity Pool (if needed for unauthenticated access)
   - Configure password policies and MFA settings

2. **Update Environment Configuration**
   - Add Cognito environment variables
   - Create configuration files for Cognito settings

3. **Develop Cognito Service Layer**
   - Implement service classes for Cognito operations
   - Create utility functions for token handling
   - Set up MFA integration

### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (3 weeks)

1. **Implement Dual Authentication System**
   - Keep NextAuth.js operational
   - Add Cognito authentication flows in parallel
   - Create feature flag to control which system is active

2. **User Migration Strategy**
   - Develop script to migrate user data to Cognito
   - Implement password migration strategy
   - Plan for MFA migration

3. **Update API Authentication**
   - Modify API routes to accept both authentication methods
   - Update middleware to validate both token types

### Phase 3: UI and Frontend Updates (2 weeks)

1. **Update Authentication UI Components**
   - Modify login, registration, and password reset flows
   - Update MFA setup and verification components
   - Implement social login integration (if applicable)

2. **Session Management Updates**
   - Update session handling in frontend
   - Implement token refresh mechanism for Cognito
   - Update user context providers

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (2 weeks)

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for authentication services
   - Integration tests for authentication flows
   - End-to-end testing of user journeys

2. **Security Audit**
   - Review token handling
   - Validate MFA implementation
   - Check for potential vulnerabilities

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing of authentication endpoints
   - Measure authentication response times

### Phase 5: Gradual Rollout and Monitoring (3 weeks)

1. **Phased User Migration**
   - Migrate admin users first
   - Gradually migrate provider users
   - Finally migrate patient users

2. **Monitoring and Metrics**
   - Set up CloudWatch metrics for authentication events
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Track successful migrations

3. **Rollback Plan**
   - Maintain ability to switch back to NextAuth.js
   - Document rollback procedures

### Phase 6: Completion and Cleanup (1 week)

1. **Finalize Migration**
   - Remove NextAuth.js code
   - Clean up dual authentication logic
   - Update documentation

2. **Post-Migration Review**
   - Gather feedback on authentication experience
   - Identify any remaining issues
   - Plan for future enhancements

## Technical Implementation Details

### User Data Migration

Users will be migrated from our database to Cognito User Pool:

1. For each user in our database:
   - Create a Cognito user with the same email
   - Set a temporary password or use password migration
   - Migrate user attributes (name, role, etc.)
   - Update user record with Cognito identifiers

### Password Migration

Two options for password migration:

1. **Option A: Reset All Passwords**
   - All users receive a password reset email
   - Users set new passwords in Cognito

2. **Option B: Custom Password Migration**
   - Implement Cognito's password migration lambda
   - Verify passwords against existing hash when users first login
   - Update to Cognito password storage after first login

### MFA Migration

For users with MFA enabled:

1. Disable MFA temporarily during migration
2. Prompt users to set up MFA again with Cognito
3. Generate new recovery codes

### Token Handling

1. Update token service to work with Cognito tokens
2. Implement JWT verification using Cognito JWKs
3. Update refresh token mechanism

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| User disruption during migration | Medium | Clear communication, phased rollout, support channels |
| Data loss during migration | High | Comprehensive backups, dry run migrations, validation checks |
| Authentication failures | High | Thorough testing, monitoring, ability to roll back |
| Performance issues | Medium | Load testing, optimization, scaling plan |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Security audit, penetration testing, following AWS best practices |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All users can authenticate using Cognito
2. All authentication features work as expected
3. No security vulnerabilities are introduced
4. Authentication performance meets or exceeds previous system
5. NextAuth.js code has been completely removed

## Timeline

Total estimated time: **13 weeks**

- Phase 1: Weeks 1-2
- Phase 2: Weeks 3-5
- Phase 3: Weeks 6-7
- Phase 4: Weeks 8-9
- Phase 5: Weeks 10-12
- Phase 6: Week 13
